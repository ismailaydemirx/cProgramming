# C Programming Training Repository

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises and projects designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in the C language. The exercises cover various fundamental topics, such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, sorting algorithms, and structures.

## Overview

The repository is organized by lessons, each focusing on a specific C programming concept. It includes both source code and compiled executable files for each lesson, providing a practical way to learn and test each concept.

## Features

- **Lesson-based Learning**: The repository is organized into lessons, each with code examples and explanations.
- **Executable Files**: For ease of use, each lesson includes an executable file alongside the source code.
- **Wide Range of Topics**: The exercises span fundamental to advanced topics, including arrays, functions, pointers, sorting algorithms, structures, and more.

## Repository Structure

- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview and instructions for the repository.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- **Source Code Files (.c)**: These files contain the code for each lesson. They cover a variety of topics:
  - **Ders1.c to Ders47.c**: Source code files for each lesson.
  - **Ders1.exe to Ders47.exe**: Executable files corresponding to each lesson.

## Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Basic data types and variables in C.
2. **Control Structures**: If-else statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch-case statements.
3. **Arrays**: One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
4. **Functions**: Function definitions, return values, and function calls.
5. **Pointers**: Understanding pointers, pointer manipulation, and pointer arrays.
6. **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort.
7. **Structures**: Using structures to group different data types together.
8. **Advanced Topics**: Pointers and arrays, functions with structures, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```
     git clone <github.com/ismailaydemirx/cProgramming>
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
   
2. **Compile and Run**:
   - To compile and run the source code for a specific lesson, use a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
     ```
     gcc <filename.c> -o <outputname>
     ./<outputname>
     ```

3. **Executable Files**:
   - The `.exe` files can be directly executed if you are using a Windows machine, or appropriate compiled executables for your platform will be generated if you follow the compilation steps above.
